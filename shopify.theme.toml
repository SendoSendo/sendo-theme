# Shopify Theme Environments
# Usage:
#   shopify theme dev                           (auto-uses default → dev theme)
#   shopify theme push                          (auto-pushes to dev theme)
#   shopify theme push -e production            (pushes to live — needs --allow-live)
#   shopify theme pull                          (pulls from dev theme)

# Default environment — used when no -e flag is passed
[environments.default]
store = "sendo-8829.myshopify.com"
theme = "185554632986"

# Explicit development environment (same as default)
[environments.development]
store = "sendo-8829.myshopify.com"
theme = "185554632986"

# Production — the live theme
[environments.production]
store = "sendo-8829.myshopify.com"
